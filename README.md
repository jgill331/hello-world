This Readme was set up in a new repository as part of an introduction to GitHub

I'm a Picses, which means that I don't take no gruff from NOBODY!   I do what I want!
My hero is Zach Efron.  I only hope to be like Zach when I grow up.

Still waiting for a flying car, but will settle for a self-driving vehicle before I kick it.
